# Introduction

It is human instinct to be sceptical of a new paradigm. To put some
perspective on how far we have come, and the shifts we have already
accepted on the JVM, let's start with a quick recap of the last 20
years.

Java 1.2 introduced the Collections API, allowing us to write methods
that abstracted over mutable collections. It was useful for writing
general purpose algorithms and was the bedrock of our codebases.

But there was a problem, we had to perform runtime casting:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  public String first(Collection collection) {
    return (String)(collection.get(0));
  }
~~~~~~~~

In response, developers defined domain objects in their business logic
that were effectively `CollectionOfThings`, and the Collection API
became implementation detail.

In 2005, Java 5 introduced *generics*, allowing us to define
`Collection<Thing>`, abstracting over the container **and** its
elements. Generics changed how we wrote Java.

The author of the Java generics compiler, Martin Odersky, then created
Scala with a stronger type system, immutable data and multiple
inheritance. This brought about a fusion of object oriented (OOP) and
functional programming (FP).

For most developers, FP means using immutable data as much as
possible, but mutable state is still a necessary evil that must be
isolated and managed, e.g. with Akka actors or `synchronized` classes.
This style of FP results in simpler programs that are easier to
parallelise and distribute, an improvement over Java. But it is only
scratching the surface of the benefits of FP, as we will discover in
this book.

Scala also brings `Future`, making it easy to write asynchronous
applications. But when a `Future` makes it into a return type,
*everything* needs to be rewritten to accommodate it, including the
tests, which are now subject to arbitrary timeouts.

We have a problem similar to Java 1.0: there is no way of abstracting
over execution, much as we had no way of abstracting over collections.


## Abstracting over Execution

Say we want to interact with the user over the command line interface. We can
`read` what the user types and we can `write` a message to them.

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  trait TerminalSync {
    def read(): String
    def write(t: String): Unit
  }
  
  trait TerminalAsync {
    def read(): Future[String]
    def write(t: String): Future[Unit]
  }
~~~~~~~~

How do we write generic code that does something as simple as echo the user's
input synchronously or asynchronously depending on our runtime implementation?

We could write a synchronous version and wrap it with `Future` but now
we have to worry about which thread pool we should be using for the
work, or we could `Await.result` on the `Future` and introduce thread
blocking. In either case, it is a lot of boilerplate and we are
fundamentally dealing with different APIs that are not unified.

We can solve the problem, like Java 1.2, with a common parent using the *higher
kinded types* (HKT) Scala language feature.

A> **Higher Kinded Types** allow us to use a *type constructor* in our type
A> parameters, which looks like `C[_]`. This is a way of saying that
A> whatever `C` is, it must take a type parameter. For example:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   trait Foo[C[_]] {
A>     def create(i: Int): C[Int]
A>   }
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> `List` is a type constructor because it takes a type (e.g. `Int`) and constructs
A> a type (`List[Int]`). We can implement `Foo` using `List`:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   object FooList extends Foo[List] {
A>     def create(i: Int): List[Int] = List(i)
A>   }
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> We can implement `Foo` for anything with a type parameter hole, e.g.
A> `Either[String, _]`. Unfortunately it is a bit clunky and we have to
A> create a type alias to trick the compiler into accepting it:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   type EitherString[T] = Either[String, T]
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> Type aliases don't define new types, they just use substitution and
A> don't provide extra type safety. The compiler substitutes
A> `EitherString[T]` with `Either[String, T]` everywhere. This technique
A> can be used to trick the compiler into accepting types with one hole
A> when it would otherwise think there are two, like when we implement
A> `Foo` with `EitherString`:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   object FooEitherString extends Foo[EitherString] {
A>     def create(i: Int): Either[String, Int] = Right(i)
A>   }
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> Alternatively, the [kind projector](https://github.com/non/kind-projector/) plugin allows us to avoid the `type`
A> alias and use `?` syntax to tell the compiler where the type hole is:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   object FooEitherString extends Foo[Either[String, ?]] {
A>     def create(i: Int): Either[String, Int] = Right(i)
A>   }
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> Finally, there is this one weird trick we can use when we want to ignore the
A> type constructor. Define a type alias to be equal to its parameter:
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   type Id[T] = T
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> 
A> Before proceeding, understand that `Id[Int]` is the same thing as `Int`, by
A> substituting `Int` into `T`. Because `Id` is a valid type constructor we can use
A> `Id` in an implementation of `Foo`
A> 
A> {lang="text"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>   object FooId extends Foo[Id] {
A>     def create(i: Int): Int = i
A>   }
A> ~~~~~~~~

We want to define `Terminal` for a type constructor `C[_]`. By
defining `Now` to construct to its type parameter (like `Id`), we can
implement a common interface for synchronous and asynchronous
terminals:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  trait Terminal[C[_]] {
    def read: C[String]
    def write(t: String): C[Unit]
  }
  
  type Now[X] = X
  
  object TerminalSync extends Terminal[Now] {
    def read: String = ???
    def write(t: String): Unit = ???
  }
  
  object TerminalAsync extends Terminal[Future] {
    def read: Future[String] = ???
    def write(t: String): Future[Unit] = ???
  }
~~~~~~~~

We can think of `C` as a *Context* because we say "in the context of
executing `Now`" or "in the `Future`".

But we know nothing about `C` and we cannot do anything with a
`C[String]`. What we need is a kind of execution environment that lets
us call a method returning `C[T]` and then be able to do something
with the `T`, including calling another method on `Terminal`. We also
need a way of wrapping a value as a `C[_]`. This signature works well:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  trait Execution[C[_]] {
    def chain[A, B](c: C[A])(f: A => C[B]): C[B]
    def create[B](b: B): C[B]
  }
~~~~~~~~

letting us write:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  def echo[C[_]](t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
    e.chain(t.read) { in: String =>
      e.chain(t.write(in)) { _: Unit =>
        e.create(in)
      }
    }
~~~~~~~~

We can now share the `echo` implementation between synchronous and
asynchronous codepaths. We can write a mock implementation of
`Terminal[Now]` and use it in our tests without any timeouts.

Implementations of `Execution[Now]` and `Execution[Future]` are
reusable by generic methods like `echo`.

But the code for `echo` is horrible!

The `implicit class` Scala language feature gives `C` some methods.
We will call these methods `flatMap` and `map` for reasons that will
become clearer in a moment. Each method takes an `implicit
Execution[C]`, but this is nothing more than the `flatMap` and `map`
that we're used to on `Seq`, `Option` and `Future`

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  object Execution {
    implicit class Ops[A, C[_]](c: C[A]) {
      def flatMap[B](f: A => C[B])(implicit e: Execution[C]): C[B] =
            e.chain(c)(f)
      def map[B](f: A => B)(implicit e: Execution[C]): C[B] =
            e.chain(c)(f andThen e.create)
    }
  }
  
  def echo[C[_]](implicit t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
    t.read.flatMap { in: String =>
      t.write(in).map { _: Unit =>
        in
      }
    }
~~~~~~~~

We can now reveal why we used `flatMap` as the method name: it lets us
use a *for comprehension*, which is just syntax sugar over nested
`flatMap` and `map`.

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  def echo[C[_]](implicit t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
    for {
      in <- t.read
       _ <- t.write(in)
    } yield in
~~~~~~~~

Our `Execution` has the same signature as a trait in Scalaz called `Monad`,
except `chain` is `bind` and `create` is `pure`. We say that `C` is *monadic*
when there is an implicit `Monad[C]` available. In addition, Scalaz has the `Id`
type alias.

The takeaway is: if we write methods that operate on monadic types,
then we can write sequential code that abstracts over its execution
context. Here, we have shown an abstraction over synchronous and
asynchronous execution but it can also be for the purpose of more
rigorous error handling (where `C[_]` is `Either[Error, _]`), managing
access to volatile state, performing I/O, or auditing of the session.


## Pure Functional Programming

Functional Programming is the act of writing programs with *pure functions*.
Pure functions have three properties:

-   **Total**: return a value for every possible input
-   **Deterministic**: return the same value for the same input
-   **Inculpable**: no (direct) interaction with the world or program state.

Together, these properties give us an unprecedented ability to reason about our
code. For example, input validation is easier to isolate with totality, caching
is possible when functions are deterministic, and interacting with the world is
easier to control, and test, when functions are inculpable.

The kinds of things that break these properties are *side effects*: directly
accessing or changing mutable state (e.g. maintaining a `var` in a class or
using a legacy API that is impure), communicating with external resources (e.g.
files or network lookup), or throwing and catching exceptions.

We write pure functions by avoiding exceptions, and interacting with the world
only through a safe `F[_]` execution context.

In the previous section, we abstracted over execution and defined `echo[Id]` and
`echo[Future]`. We might reasonably expect that calling any `echo` will not
perform any side effects, because it is pure. However, if we use `Future` or
`Id` as the execution context, our application will start listening to stdin:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  val futureEcho: Future[String] = echo[Future]
~~~~~~~~

We have broken purity and are no longer writing FP code: `futureEcho` is the
result of running `echo` once. `Future` conflates the definition of a program
with *interpreting* it (running it). As a result, applications built with
`Future` are difficult to reason about.

A> An expression is *referentially transparent* if it can be replaced with its
A> corresponding value without changing the program's behaviour.
A> 
A> Pure functions are referentially transparent, allowing for a great deal of code
A> reuse, performance optimisation, understanding, and control of a program.
A> 
A> Impure functions are not referentially transparent. We cannot replace
A> `echo[Future]` with a value, such as `val futureEcho`, since the pesky user can
A> type something different the second time.

We can define a simple safe `F[_]` execution context

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  final class IO[A](val interpret: () => A) {
    def map[B](f: A => B): IO[B] = IO(f(interpret()))
    def flatMap[B](f: A => IO[B]): IO[B] = IO(f(interpret()).interpret())
  }
  object IO {
    def apply[A](a: =>A): IO[A] = new IO(() => a)
  }
~~~~~~~~

which lazily evaluates a thunk. `IO` is just a data structure that references
(potentially) impure code, it isn't actually running anything. We can implement
`Terminal[IO]`

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  object TerminalIO extends Terminal[IO] {
    def read: IO[String]           = IO { io.StdIn.readLine }
    def write(t: String): IO[Unit] = IO { println(t) }
  }
~~~~~~~~

and call `echo[IO]` to get back a value

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  val delayed: IO[String] = echo[IO]
~~~~~~~~

This `val delayed` can be reused, it is just the definition of the work to be
done. We can map the `String` and compose additional programs, much as we would
map over a `Future`. `IO` keeps us honest that we are depending on some
interaction with the world, but does not prevent us from accessing the output of
that interaction.

The impure code inside the `IO` is only evaluated when we `.interpret()` the
value, which is an impure action

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  delayed.interpret()
~~~~~~~~

An application composed of `IO` programs is only interpreted once, in the `main`
method, which is also called *the end of the world*.

In this book, we expand on the concepts introduced in this chapter and show how
to write maintainable, pure functions, that achieve our business's objectives.
